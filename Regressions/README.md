##Regressions

I implemented two regression method, [Polynomial Regression](https://raw.github.com/jiwoongim/mlTool/master/regressions/polyRegression.py)
and [Bayesian Curive Fitting with Evidence Approximation](https://raw.github.com/jiwoongim/mlTool/master/regressions/bayesianCurveFit_EvidenceApproximation.py).
For the simple testing purpose, I generated toydata from degree 3 polynomial with gaussian noise added. I Sampled 60
points, and selected random 40 points as train dat and rest of 20 points as test data. 

##Polynomial Regression

After running 10trials with different amount of train and test set.

train/test   LSDE PolyReg on train | LSDE Bay on train | LSDE on PolyReg test | LSDE on Bay test
50 / 50        7.0232 +- 0.1781       7.0237 +- 0.1780      7.1729 +- 0.2173      7.1701 +- 0.22 



Here are two plots that was generated using polynomial regression.
