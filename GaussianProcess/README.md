## Gaussian Process
Implemented Gaussian Process using various different types of kernel. Some of the 
kernels are square exponetial, absolute expopential, brownian motion, and linear.
```Implemented in matlab and python, but bug in python haven't solved yet.```

##Non-Stationary Kernel
As you can see below that they are non stational kernel, since the plots all starts 
from the same points.
