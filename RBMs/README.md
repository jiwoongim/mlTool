## Restricted Boltzmann Machine

1. Implemented RBM, Gaussian RBM, RBM with Rectified Linear Units.
2. Implemented Discriminative RBM.

### 1. RBM, Gaussian RBM, RBM with Rectified Linear Units
I experimented those three models by training subet of MNIST data, and generating image from
the three models.
I used 400 hidden units for all three models. From the generated images
from each model, I could see their characters/behaviour.

Original Face Image

Generated Face using Rectified Linear Units for the visible layer.



### 2. Discriminative RBM

The discriminative RBM has interconnection between hidden layer with input layer, and also hidden layer with class label 
layers. Similar to the diagram shown:\\

however the results I found aren't satisfied yet...
