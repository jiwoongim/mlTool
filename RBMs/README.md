## Restricted Boltzmann Machine

1. Implemented RBM, Gaussian RBM, RBM with Rectified Linear Units.
2. Implemented Discriminative RBM.

### RBM, Gaussian RBM, RBM with Rectified Linear Units
I experimented those three models by training subet of MNIST data, and generating image from
the three models. I used 400 hidden units for all three models. From the generated images
from each model, I could see their characters/behaviour.
